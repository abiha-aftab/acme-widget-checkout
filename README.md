### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abiha-aftab/acme-widget-checkout.git
cd acme-widget-checkout
```

## âœ¨ Design Approach

### Object-Oriented Design

- **Basket**: Maintains a list of items and calculates totals with offers and delivery
- **Product**: Represents each purchasable item with code, name, and price
- **Offers**: Encapsulated as pluggable rules (e.g., BuyOneGetSecondHalfPrice)
- **DeliveryCalculator**: Handles delivery fee logic based on subtotal
- **DeliveryRule**: Defines delivery pricing rules based on threshold and charge
- **Invoice**: Formats and displays basket totals as an invoice

### Extendability

- Easily add new offer types by implementing an `#apply(items)` method on the Offer base class
- Delivery rules and pricing strategies are decoupled from core basket logic
- Simple interface for adding new product types and delivery tiers

### Dependency Injection

- Basket gets injected with offers, delivery calculator, and product catalog
- Promotes testability and flexibility
- Clear separation of concerns
